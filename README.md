This is a project on responsive design, I have copied the site thenextweb.com.
The aim of this project is not to copy the features rather just the responsive
nature of the site. Therefore lots of features are not present simply because
I didn't want to focus on them I just wanted to get the general responsive nature of the website correct, you can see that the side bar has no content and therefore its height is not correct, this is because I just wanted to get a general sense of removing it at a certain break point rather than it being a feature, the same for the social media links in the nav, rather than changing to a drop down menu I just change it to the word "Follow". Lots of other things have been left out eg anchor links etc.
